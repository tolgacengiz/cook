        <h3>Preperation</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1.</strong>Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast
          in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the
          surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2.</strong>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a
          well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture.
          Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.</strong>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough
          out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough
          should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.</strong>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place
          the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic
          wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5.</strong>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly
          floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4
          equal portions and shape into rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.</strong>Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen
          towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare
          the sauce and any other ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>7.</strong>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow,
          between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet
          (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the
          oven.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>8.</strong>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to
          the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer
          to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>9.</strong>Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start
          by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do
          not deflate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>10.</strong>Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet
          and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients
          of your choice.
